# Messenger Unwrapped

**Analyze your Facebook Messenger chats and discover hidden patterns.**

Messenger Unwrapped is a Python application designed to help you understand your messaging habits. It works by:

* **Extracting and cleaning chat data** from Facebook JSON files.
* **Analyzing key metrics:**  
    * Most used words and emojis
    * Message distribution across participants
    * Message frequency over time (heatmaps)
* **Exporting insights:** Save cleaned data as a CSV for further exploration.

**Why use Messenger Unwrapped?**

* **Understand your communication patterns:** See who you message most, your favorite words, and when you're most active.
* **Dive into group dynamics:** Analyze word usage and message distribution within group chats.
* **Personalize your data journey:**  Use the exported CSV for custom analysis or create your own visualizations.

## Features
### Data Handling and Preparation
This application includes a robust process for preparing Facebook Messenger chat data, which involves data extraction and cleaning:

### Data Extraction
- **Data Aggregation:** The application employs scripts (`single_folder.py` for individual chats and `all_folders.py` for all chats) to handle the extraction process. These scripts read JSON files from the specified directory, converting the contained JSON dictionaries into a list.
- **DataFrame Creation:** The listed dictionaries are then transformed into a unified DataFrame. This process is identical whether analyzing a single chat or combining multiple chats.

### Data Cleaning and Transformation
- **Initial Processing:** The `clean_messages` function takes the unified DataFrame and begins the cleaning process.
- **Enhancing Data Readability:** Timestamps are converted into separate date and time columns for better readability. Columns are renamed for easier navigation, and rows with irrelevant data are filtered out.
- **Data Enrichment:** Each message row is enriched with word and emoji counts, providing detailed insights for analysis.
- **Finalized DataFrame:** The result is a well-organized DataFrame, where all necessary information is cleanly presented and extraneous data is removed.

### Analytical Features
Once the data is prepared, the application offers a range of features to analyze and visualize the chat data:

1. **Message Stats:** This feature aggregates messaging statistics into a table showing each participant's message count, word count, and call duration. Notably, the call duration reflects the time for calls initiated by each user, meaning it only increases for the person who started the call, not for other participants in the call.

2. **Top Words:** Analyzes and ranks the top 10 words used by the user and the chat partner(s). In group chats, it aggregates this data across all participants, providing a comparative word usage analysis.

3. **Emoji Analysis:** Similar to the Top Words feature, but focuses on emoji usage. It identifies and ranks the top 10 emojis used by each participant in the chat.

4. **Message Distribution:** Visualized through a donut chart, this feature shows the distribution of total messages sent by each participant in a chat. It includes the total message count in the center, with individual contributions and their percentage of the total displayed in segments.

5. **Total Message Frequency:** Generates a heat map to visualize the frequency of messages sent on different days and times. This feature provides insights into the most active periods in the chat history, offering a temporal dimension to the analysis.

6. **Export Cleaned Data to CSV:** This feature allows you to export the cleaned data from the currently selected chat into a CSV file. The CSV file will be saved in a designated folder, making it easily accessible for any additional processing or review.
